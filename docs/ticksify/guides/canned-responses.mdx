* **Title**: The title of the canned response.
* **Content**: The body of the canned response.

## Editing a canned response

To edit a canned response, click on the **Canned Responses** you want to edit in the canned responses page. Then the
edit form will be opened. Make your changes and click on the **Update Canned Response** button to save it.

Response** button in the ticket reply form. Then select the canned response you want to use, and you are done!
