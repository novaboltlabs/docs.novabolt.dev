## Installing Ticksify on local machine

To try Ticksify on your local machine, you can follow these step-by-step instructions. Ticksify is built on the Laravel framework, which supports PHP Built-in Webserver. This allows you to test the application locally before deploying it to a server.

1. Extract the Ticksify script that you downloaded from CodeCanyon. Right-click the downloaded zip archive and select "Extract" or use a file extraction tool. Choose a location on your computer where you want to store the script.

2. Open the `.env` file using a text editor. Update the following variables to match your local environment:
 ```text
 DB_DATABASE=<your-database-name>
 DB_USERNAME=<your-database-username>
 DB_PASSWORD=<your-database-password>
    ```

Replace `<your-database-name>`, `<your-database-username>`, and `<your-database-password>` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.

:::caution
In many operating systems, the .env file is hidden by default to prevent accidental modifications by users. If you can't find it in the Ticksify directory, make sure to enable the "Show hidden files" option in your file explorer or use text editor's "Open file" option to locate and open the file.
:::

3. Import the `database/data/ticksify.sql` file into your database. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench to import the file.

:::info
If you prefer to utilize sample data similar to our demo setup, instead of `ticksify.sql` you can import the `sample.sql` file. Please be aware that, to respect copyright restrictions, the sample data will not include any images.
:::

Your Ticksify application is now ready to be served. Start the PHP development server by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the Ticksify application.

:::caution
If you're using a different port for your PHP development server, make sure to update the `APP_URL` variable in your `.env` file to match the port number.
:::

By following these steps, even if you're new to this process, you can successfully set up and run Ticksify on your local machine. The next step is to [set up your application](#setting-up-the-application-and-accessing-the-admin-panel). This allows you to explore the application's features, make customizations, and test it before deploying it to a live server.

## Installing Ticksify on shared hosting

Shared hosting is a type of web hosting where multiple websites are hosted on a single server. In this setup, resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space are shared among the hosted websites.

It's important to note that shared hosting environments may have limitations compared to dedicated or cloud-based hosting solutions. Resource constraints and server configurations imposed by the hosting provider may impact the performance or availability of your Laravel application.

It is recommended to review your hosting plan and ensure it meets the requirements of running a Laravel application effectively.

:::info
There are many shared hosting providers that offer Laravel hosting plans. You can search for them on Google or other search engines. Some of the popular ones are [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/laravel-hosting), [A2 Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/laravel-hosting), and [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/laravel-hosting.htm).

### Preparing the Database

Before installing Ticksify on your hosting server, you need to create a database. Most hosting providers offer a database management tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench. You can use these tools to create a database and import the database tables.

#### Step 1: Creating a Database

1. From your hosting control panel navigate to the **Databases** section and click on **MySQLÂ® Databases**.
2. Under **Create a New MySQL Database And Database User**, fill in the following fields:
    * *MySQL database name*, enter a name for your database.
    * *MySQL username*, enter a username for your database.
    * *Password*, enter a password for your database.
3. Click on **Create** to create the database and user.

#### Step 2: Importing the Database Tables

1. Navigate to the **Databases** section and click on **phpMyAdmin**.
2. Select the database you created from the left sidebar.
3. Click on the **Import** tab.
4. Click on **Choose File** and select the `ticksify.sql` file located in the `database/data` directory of the Ticksify script.
5. Click on **Go** to import the database tables.

### Uploading the Ticksify Script

The next step is to upload the Ticksify script to your hosting server. You can use an FTP client like FileZilla to upload the script to your server. There are two methods to upload the script to your server:

#### Method 1: The easy way

This method is the easiest way to install Ticksify on your shared hosting server.

#### Step 1: Uploading Ticksify to your Hosting Server

1. Connect to your hosting server using an FTP client like FileZilla.
2. Upload the entire Ticksify directory to the root document directory of your website (usually `public_html`). Verify that the directory structure looks like this:

```text
|- ...
|- public_html
    - app
    - bootstrap
    - config
    - database
    - ...
```

#### Step 2: Updating the Application Configuration

1. Locate the `.env` file in the `public_html` directory.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Edit** to open it in a text editor.
3. Locate the line that starts with `APP_URL=`. It should look like this:
    ```text
    APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
    Replace the value after the equals sign with the URL of your website (eg. `http://example.com`).
4. Next look for the following lines:
    ```text
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
    Replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.
5. Save the changes and close the file.

#### Step 3: Adding the Storage Directory Link Route

1. Open your web browser and visit your website's URL with `/storage-link` at the end (e.g., https://example.com/storage-link).
2. A message will appear saying a symbolic link was created. If you see an error message, you may need to contact your hosting provider to enable the `symlink` PHP extension.

Your Ticksify application is now ready to be served. Open your web browser and visit your website's URL to access the Ticksify application.

#### Method 2: The secure way

This method is more secure than the previous one. It involves moving the files outside the `public_html` directory and modifying the `index.php` file to point to the new location. This method is recommended if you want to keep your application files outside the public directory.

#### Step 1: Uploading Ticksify to your Hosting Server

1. Connect to your hosting server using an FTP client like FileZilla.
2. Upload the entire Ticksify directory to the root directory of your website (not inside the `public_html` folder).
3. Verify that the directory structure looks like this:

```text
|- ...
|- public_html
|- ticksify
    - app
    - bootstrap
    - config
    - database
    - ...
```

#### Step 2: Moving Files to the public_html Folder

1. Open the `ticksify` directory on your server and locate the `public` folder.
2. Move all the files and folders inside the `public` folder to the `public_html` folder.
3. After moving, the directory structure of your `public_html` folder should resemble this:

```text
|- ...
|- public_html
    |- build
    |- img
    |- favicon.ico
    |- index.php
    |- robots.txt
|- ticksify
    - app
    - bootstrap
    - config
    - ...
```

#### Step 3: Modifying the index.php File

1. Locate the `index.php` file inside the `public_html` folder.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Edit** to open it in a code editor.
3. Look for the following lines in the file:
    ```php
    // line 34
    require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/autoload.php';

    // line 47
    $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
    ```
4. Replace them with the following lines:
    ```php
    // line 34
    require __DIR__.'/../ticksify/bootstrap/autoload.php';

    // line 47
    $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../ticksify/bootstrap/app.php';
    ```
5. Save the changes and close the code editor.

#### Step 4: Updating the Application Configuration

1. Locate the `.env` file in the `public_html` directory.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Edit** to open it in a text editor.
3. Locate the line that starts with `APP_URL=`. It should look like this:
    ```text
    APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
    Replace the value after the equals sign with the URL of your website (eg. `http://example.com`).
4. Look for the following lines:
    ```text
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
    Replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.
5. Save the changes and close the file.

#### Step 5: Adding the Storage Directory Link Route

1. Open your web browser and visit your website's URL with `/storage-link` at the end (e.g., https://example.com/storage-link).
2. A message will appear saying a symbolic link was created. If you see an error message, you may need to contact your hosting provider to enable the `symlink` PHP extension.

#### Step 6: Moving the Storage Directory

1. Inside the `ticksify/public` folder, locate the `storage` directory.
2. Move the `storage` directory to the same level as the `index.php` file in the `public_html` folder.
3. Confirm that your `public_html` directory structure now looks like this:
    ```text
    |- build
    |- img
    |- storage
    |- favicon.ico
    |- index.php
    |- robots.txt
    ```

Your Ticksify application is now ready to be served. Open your web browser and visit your website's URL to access the Ticksify application.
