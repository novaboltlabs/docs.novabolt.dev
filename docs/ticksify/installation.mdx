## Installing Ticksify on local machine

To try Ticksify on your local machine, you can follow these step-by-step instructions. Ticksify is built on the Laravel framework, which supports PHP Built-in Webserver. This allows you to test the application locally before deploying it to a server.

:::caution
Before you start, make sure you have configured the PHP executable path in your system environment variables so that you can run PHP commands from your terminal or command prompt.
:::

1. Extract the Ticksify script that you downloaded from CodeCanyon. Right-click the downloaded zip archive and select "Extract" or use a file extraction tool. Choose a location on your computer where you want to store the script.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the Ticksify script using the `cd` command. For example, if you extracted it to the "ticksify" folder on your desktop, you would use the following command:

```bash
cd Desktop/ticksify
```

Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. This file contains the configuration variables for the application. If you're using a Mac or Linux machine, you can use the following command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file using a text editor. Update the following variables to match your local environment:

```text
DB_DATABASE=<your-database-name>
DB_USERNAME=<your-database-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-database-password>
```

Replace `<your-database-name>`, `<your-database-username>`, and `<your-database-password>` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.

Import the `database/data/ticksify.sql` file into your database. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench to import the file.

:::info
If you prefer to utilize sample data similar to our demo setup, you can import the `database/data/sample.sql` file. Please be aware that, to respect copyright restrictions, the sample data will not include any images.
:::

Your Ticksify site is now ready to be served. Start the PHP development server by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the Ticksify application.

:::caution
If you're using a different port for your PHP development server, make sure to update the `APP_URL` variable in your `.env` file to match the port number.
:::

By following these steps, even if you're new to this process, you can successfully set up and run Ticksify on your local machine. This allows you to explore the application's features, make customizations, and test it before deploying it to a live server.

## Installing Ticksify on shared hosting

Shared hosting is a type of web hosting where multiple websites are hosted on a single server. In this setup, resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space are shared among the hosted websites.

It's important to note that shared hosting environments may have limitations compared to dedicated or cloud-based hosting solutions. Resource constraints and server configurations imposed by the hosting provider may impact the performance or availability of your Laravel application.

It is recommended to review your hosting plan and ensure it meets the requirements of running a Laravel application effectively.

:::info
There are many shared hosting providers that offer Laravel hosting plans. You can search for them on Google or other search engines. Some of the popular ones are [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/laravel-hosting), [A2 Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/laravel-hosting), and [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/laravel-hosting.htm).
:::

To successfully install Ticksify on your chosen hosting provider, follow the steps outlined below.

#### Step 1: Uploading Ticksify to your Hosting Server

1. Connect to your hosting server using an FTP client like FileZilla.
2. Upload the entire Ticksify directory to the root directory of your website (not inside the `public_html` folder).
3. Verify that the directory structure looks like this:

```text
|- ...
|- public_html
|- ticksify
    - app
    - bootstrap
    - config
    - database
    - ...
```

#### Step 2: Moving Files to the public_html Folder

1. Open the `ticksify` directory on your server and locate the `public` folder.
2. Move all the files and folders inside the `public` folder to the `public_html` folder.
3. After moving, the directory structure of your `public_html` folder should resemble this:

```text
|- ...
|- public_html
    |- build
    |- img
    |- favicon.ico
    |- index.php
    |- robots.txt
|- ticksify
    - app
    - bootstrap
    - config
    - ...
```

#### Step 3: Modifying the index.php File

1. Locate the `index.php` file inside the `public_html` folder.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Edit** to open it in a code editor.
3. Look for the following lines in the file:
    ```php
    // line 34
    require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/autoload.php';

    // line 47
    $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
    ```
4. Replace them with the following lines:
    ```php
    // line 34
    require __DIR__.'/../ticksify/bootstrap/autoload.php';

    // line 47
    $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../ticksify/bootstrap/app.php';
    ```
5. Save the changes and close the code editor.

#### Step 4: Creating a Database

1. From your hosting control panel navigate to the **Databases** section and click on **MySQLÂ® Databases**.
2. Under **Create a New MySQL Database And Database User**, fill in the following fields:
    * *MySQL database name*, enter a name for your database.
    * *MySQL username*, enter a username for your database.
    * *Password*, enter a password for your database.
3. Click on **Create** to create the database and user.

#### Step 5: Importing the Database Tables

1. Navigate to the **Databases** section and click on **phpMyAdmin**.
2. Select the database you created from the left sidebar.
3. Click on the **Import** tab.
4. Click on **Choose File** and select the `ticksify.sql` file from the `ticksify/database/data` folder.
5. Click on **Go** to import the database tables.

#### Step 6: Updating the Database Configuration

1. Locate the `.env` file in the `ticksify` directory.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Edit** to open it in a text editor.
3. Look for the following lines:
    ```text
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```
4. Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.
5. Save the changes and close the file.

#### Step 7: Updating the Application URL

1. Open the `.env` file again.
2. Locate the line that starts with `APP_URL=`. It should look like this:
    ```text
    APP_URL=http://localhost
    ```
3. Replace the value after the equals sign with the URL of your website.
4. Save the changes and close the file.

#### Step 8: Linking the Storage Directory

1. Open the `ticksify/routes/web.php` file in a text editor.
2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
    ```php
    Route::get('/linkstorage', function () {
        Artisan::call('storage:link');
    });
    ```
3. Save the file and close the editor.

#### Step 9: Verifying the Storage Directory Link

1. Open your web browser and visit your website's URL.
2. Add "/linkstorage" to the end of the URL (e.g., https://example.com/linkstorage).
3. If a blank page with no errors appears, the storage directory has been linked successfully.
4. Remove the "/linkstorage" route from the `ticksify/routes/web.php` file.

#### Step 10: Moving the Storage Directory

1. Inside the `ticksify/public` folder, locate the `storage` directory.
2. Move the `storage` directory to the same level as the `index.php` file in the `public_html` folder.
3. Confirm that your `public_html` directory structure now looks like this:
    ```text
    |- build
    |- img
    |- storage
    |- favicon.ico
    |- index.php
    |- robots.txt
    ```

That's it! You have successfully installed Ticksify on your shared hosting. You can now visit your website and start using Ticksify to build your store!
