# Translation

The Cartify application may be translated into any language. To do this, follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Identify the target language**

Determine which language you want to translate your Cartify application into. Let's assume you want to translate it into French.

**Step 2: Locate the language files**

The language files for your Cartify application are typically stored in the `lang` directory. Find the `en.json` file, which contains the English translations.

**Step 3: Create a new language file**

Copy the `en.json` file and create a new file named `fr.json` (for French). This will be the file where you'll add the translated strings.

**Step 4: Translate the strings**

Open the `fr.json` file and start translating the strings one by one. Each string has a corresponding key. Locate the key in the `en.json` file and replace the English translation with the corresponding French translation in the `fr.json` file. Repeat this process for all the strings you want to translate.

**Step 5: Set the locale**

To ensure that Cartify uses the correct language, open the `config/app.php` file and set the 'locale' value to 'fr'.

**Step 6: Test the translation**

Launch your Cartify application and navigate to the pages containing the translated strings. Verify that the strings are displayed in the correct language (French in this case). Make any necessary adjustments to the translations if needed.

** Step 7: Repeat for other languages (optional)**

If you want to translate your application into multiple languages, repeat steps 3 to 6 for each target language. Create a new language file for each language and translate the strings accordingly.

That's it! By following these steps, you can translate your Cartify application from the `en.json` file to another language. Remember to keep the original en.json file intact as it serves as the fallback language if a translation is missing in the target language file.
