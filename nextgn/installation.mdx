* and the following PHP extensions _**(which on most systems will be installed by default)**_:

## Installing Ticksify on Virtual Private Server (VPS)

To get Ticksify installed on your VPS you will need to download the zip archive from CodeCanyon and extract it to your
desired directory. You may do so with this command:

```bash
unzip ticksify-x.x.x.zip -d ticksify && cd ticksify
```

:::tip
You should replace `x.x.x` with the version number of the archive you have downloaded.
:::

Next, from your application directory run the following command to install all composer dependencies like so:

```bash
composer install
```

### Creating environment configuration file

After the composer installation process is finished you will need to make a copy of **.env.example** to **.env** (this
is where our application stores all the configuration variables). Use the following command to do so:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Otherwise, you may use your text editor to create a `.env` file into your application root directory with the content
copied from our `.env.example` file.

### Creating application key

The next thing you should do after installing Ticksify is to set your application key to a random string, and you may do
it with the following command:

```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

There is an alternative way to create the application key by using your text editor to edit the `.env` file. On
the `APP_KEY=` variable then enters the value of 32 random characters like so:

```text
APP_KEY=oxVRayeDkVduD4oUAx3TiqNYoEeTrXY
```

:::warning
If the application key is not set, all user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secured! In fact, your
application may not run at all.
