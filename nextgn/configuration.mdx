    MAIL_HOST=your_smtp_host
    MAIL_PORT=your_smtp_port

    MAIL_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=your_smtp_encryption
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email_address
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Name"
    ```
3. Replace the placeholders with your specific email configuration details:
    * Set MAIL_MAILER to "smtp".
